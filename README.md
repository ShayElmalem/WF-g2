# WF-g2
Wide-field photon correlation calculation


A MATLAB (and soon also Python) code for both:
(1) straight forward  
(2) computioaionlly efficient 
calulation of wide-field second order photon correlation calculation.

for testing, run the test_g2.m script.

Tested in MATLAB R2021b.
MEX and MEX-CUDA files might require re-compilation on your local machine.

The code is released under the GNU license.
